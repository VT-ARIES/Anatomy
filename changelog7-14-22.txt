This is a bulk update, many changes done as follows:


Many UI Updates
- Implementing Karina's UI -> changes to main.css e.g. backgrounds, button styles, etc.
- Added a navigation (page) system to main.js:
	- div elements on index.html with attribute id="id" can be added to a "page"
		that is shown/hidden when navigated to/from
- Added a search/filtering functionality:
	- A Bones list contains all bones found in a model
		- When clicked on, that bone will be selected and list element will change styles
	- User can type into search bar that will dynamically filter bones depending on query
- Added a random paw generator (See /js/bgpawgenerator.js)

Organized and modularized (is that a word?) Model Class and imports (see /js/classes/models)
- Added dynamic fields like picture URL and description
- See new section in ReadMe for adding models:
	- See /js/classes/models/Daniel.js for demo model
	- See /js/classes/models/models.js for how to add model
	- Actual GLB Models still added the same way (in /models/<model_name>), again see Daniel.js

Modified some rendering and event code, including:
- "Browsing" vs "Selected" states, shown in UI sidebar tool
- When browsing and mouse is not over a bone, instead of showing "last hovered" bone now shows no bone selected
- Different types of selection (clicking on bone vs clicking on bone list item)

Changed loading screen to be percentage based

Found potential fix for scaling in VR:
    if (renderer.xr.isPresenting)
        scene.scale.set( 0.01, 0.01, 0.01 ); Scale needs to be fine-tuned

Deleted z-brush files (Zac)
